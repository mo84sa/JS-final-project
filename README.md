### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced task to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll show off everything you've learned in the last two weeks!

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework & tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Use a 3rd party API and render the data**
* **Be an interactive, single page app**
* **Be a complete product**
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible. 

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working single page app**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A presentation** which explains:
    * What **technologies** you used
    * The **general approach you took**
    * Any wireframes, user stories, and proposed architecture
    * Any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome
    * Anything you are particularly **proud** of! 
    * A **demonstration of your working app**

### Project Proposal DUE TONIGHT April 28

The API you choose for your app is going to be a huge part of your project. Making sure you find the right one is essential. Tonight research different APIs and think about what you want to do. MAKE SURE TO TEST OUT YOUR API END POINT!!! You don't want to run into any surprises about what data you will be getting back. Open up an issue on this repository with the following:

- Name of your app 
- What the app will do?
- What API will you use?
  - Link to the documentation
  - An example endpoint
  - What data will you use from it?
- Anything else that will help us understand what you are creating!

Not sure where to start? Try going to [the list of public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) and finding one that sounds interesting!

### Example Ideas

- An app where you can search and get info about TV shows using the [tv maze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) then save your favorites!
- A recent news feed using [NPR One](https://dev.npr.org/), [Hearst Publishing Group](http://www.hearst.com/) or both!
- An app where you can find local pizza places using the [Google Places API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/places/)
